# What this is
This is an attempt to use neural ode instead of quadrature for NeRF.

# Get Fern Data
You can just run `cd nerf && sh ./download_example_data.sh && cd ..`, which should download all the necessary data for the fern scene.

# PyCall Python Environment Setup
Make sure your `PYTHON` environment variable is set to the version of python with necessary dependencies to run `nerf/load_llff.py`.
If you're not sure what to install, you can see `nerf/README.md` for instructions on how to set up a conda environment to run all the NeRF code.
